# Features

This extension will automatically fold code when files are opened if a magic
comment is found.

	vscode-fold=#

It does not matter how you put that in your file. All that matters is that you
put it somewhere your project won't syntax error on it - so within a single
or multiline comment.

Automatic folding only happens when opened. If they are already open, they will
stay as you have them.
